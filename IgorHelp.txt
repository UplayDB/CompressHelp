MENUS

File menu
  Igor primarily works with mission files (*.mis).  These are the files managed in the File menu.  User mods can be created and activated with the Mods dialog.

Edit menu
  The undo feature tracks all changes to the loaded mission file.  The undo buffer is cleared when you save the mission.  Map, mission, and briefing properties are also available from the Edit menu.

View menu
  These toggles can be used to filter the display of objects and map information.

Script menu
  The import and export options are for working with game type files (*.gtf).  Each of these files contains a stand-alone script.  Use the Edit option to access the script editor.

Tools menu
  These editors can be used to tweak many game parameters.  Many of them are not directly related to mission creation.  The command map generator constructs a rough backdrop image for new maps.
